# CRT.sh Certificate Search Recon Script

 This bash script makes it easy to quickly download and parse
 the output from https://crt.sh website. All you need to supply
 is the search term to query crt.sh for. Note that I've never had 
 any luck querying for the actual domain name.

# Example Usage:
```
crt.sh google
```
